## asynchronous telegram bot

<b>This is a final project of the first advanced semester on DLS (MIPT).</b>

### Description of project

There are two modes inside the bot.

Painter mode based on CycleGAN which was intoduced at ICCV 2017. The CycleGAN is a technique that involves the automatic training of image-to-image translation models without paired examples. The models are trained in an unsupervised manner using a collection of images from the source and target domain that do not need to be related in any way. CycleGAN is extremely usable because it doesnâ€™t need paired data.

The second mode is style mode and it based on Neural-Style algorithm developed by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge. The algorithm takes three images, an input image, a content-image, and a style-image, and changes the input to resemble the content of the content-image and the artistic style of the style-image. The are 21 pretrained NN in this bot.

### Examples

#### Paint mode

<p align = 'center'>
<img src = 'examples/ex1.jpeg' height = '500px'>
<img src = 'examples/ex2.jpeg' height = '500px'>
</p>

#### Style mode

<p align = 'center'>
<img src = 'examples/ex3.jpeg' width = '300px'>
</p>
<p align = 'center'>
<img src = 'examples/ex4.jpeg' width = '300px'>
</p>
